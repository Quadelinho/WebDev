The purpose of this project is to gather classes related directly to the business logic, like e.g. validationbased on rules defined by the business / client.
The name 'services' doesn't mean the project have to work as a service (separate process running constantly at the background) - this is just REST naming
convention. Martin Fawler suggested to use a name 'use case' instead.
